Big O notation
----------------------------

What is Big O?


A metric for algorithm efficiency
Relation to input size
Progress over time, aka “Speed”
Doesn’t care about machine specs

Also known as ‘asymptotic notation’

Assignment:
Write three functions with the following Big O:

Constant time: O(1)
Linear time: O(n)
Polynomial time: O(n^k)

*Make up your own data to write these

Off-topic Assignment:
The modular arithmetic operator (%) - a range checker

Once you feel comfortable with the basics of Big O notation
Write a “circular array” with only a single loop (for, or while).
I.e. Create a function that takes 2 parameters: an array, and an integer

The integer is the number of times the array will be printed.


You must use the mod operator
Circular Array
Just console.log the output on each loop iteration

Tip: Push these up to your algorithms repository.

Share these assignments when you’re done either publically or privately.
If you want to share them publically thread them underneath these lessons or you can just say “heres my assignment” and thread them under that (threads can reduce spoilers for others still trying to figure it out).
